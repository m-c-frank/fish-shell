# Note aux traducteurs
#
# Les traductions qui suivent sont celles qui sont recommandées ; il ne s’agit pas d’un commandement, mais
# ces traductions devraient être utilisées autant que possible afin d’uniformiser l’ensemble. En dehors de
# celles affichées ci-dessous, les traductions recommandées incluent celles utilisées pour git et celles
# utilisées pour le projet Debian.
# Normalement, les traductions ci-dessous devraient être ignorées seulement dans les cas suivants :
# * leur utilisation donnerait une traduction redondante : par exemple,
#     "Suppress the network mask"
#       donnerait suivant ces recommandations
#     "Masquer le masque résau"
#       mais cette traduction est redondante, donc on traduirait plutôt par
#     "Dissimuler le masque réseau"
# * la traduction recommandée entre en conflit avec les traductions couramment admises du logiciel visé ;
#   par exemple, si, sur un logiciel de gestion de versions, la traduction couramment admise de « repository »
#   est « référentiel », alors utilisez cette traduction au lieu de celle recommandée, afin de ne pas dérouter les
#   utilisateurs habitués au logiciel visé.
# Si le mot que vous voulez traduire n’est pas présent dans la liste, mais qu’un autre mot de la même famille y est présent,
# utilisez une traduction de la même famille que celle présente, là encore afin d’avoir un jeu de traductions cohérent.
# Par exemple, « to set » a déjà « paramétrer » comme traduction recommandée, donc « setting » est à traduire par « paramètre ».
#
# Cette liste n’a pas la prétention d’être la vérité absolue ; si une traduction recommandée mérite d’être révisée, vous
# pouvez la changer, mais vous devrez alors propager ce changement aux traductions existantes pour maintenir leur cohérence.
